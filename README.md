# UW_Fintech_Challenge_19

## Project Description
For this assignment we took two python files, the first one contained the code associated with the web interface of the application, and the second has the Ethereum transaction functions. These files allowed us to generate a new Ethereum account, display account balances from the blockchain, calculate the total value of a transaction, digitally sign a transaction and review the transaction code. 

## Technologies
**Python 3.7**  
**web3**  
**Streamlit** 
**Ganache**

## Installation Guide
Before running the application, install Python libraries web3 and Streamlit.  
```pip install web3```  
```pip install streamlit```

## Usage
Navigate to the folder where the fintech_finder.py file is saved. Run the following code to launch the web app:
streamlit run fintech_finder.py.

### In-App Usage
1. Review the fintech professional options.
2. Select the fintech professional you'd like to hire in the left-hand menu.
3. Enter in how many hours you'd like to hire the fintech professional for.
4. Verify the Ethereum address is correct and then click send transaction.
